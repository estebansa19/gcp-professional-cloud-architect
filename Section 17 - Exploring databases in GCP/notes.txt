Concepts

- RPO (Recovery Point Objective) maximum acceptable period of data loss.
- RTO (Recovery Time Objective) maximum acceptable period of downtime.



Relational databases in GCP

- OLTP (Online Transaction Processing)

  Applications where large number of users make large number of small transactions. Small reads,
  updates and deletes. You can find this in the most traditional applications, e-commerce, banking,
  etc.

  The most popular databases for these applications are: MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server, etc.

  The recommended Google managed services for this kind of applications are: CloudSQL, supports
  PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQL Server for regional databases (a few TBs of data). Cloud Spanner,
  provides unlimited scale (multiple PBs) and 99.999% availability for global applications with
  horizontal scaling.

- OLAP (Online Analytics Processing)

  Applications that allow users to analize petabytes of data. You can find this in reporting
  applications, analytic systems, etc.

  The recommended GCP managed services for this scenario are: BigQuery, petabyt-scale distributed
  data ware-house.

  This kind of databases allow you to execute very compled and distributed queries.



NoSQL databases

- GCP managed services for this kind of databases.

  Cloud Firestore, serverless based in documents database. Provides ACID, SQL-like queries and
  indexes. It was designed for transactional web and mobile applications. Recommended to small to
  medium databases (0 to a few terabytes).

  Cloud BigTable, wide column database. Recommended for a lot of data (from terabytes to several
  petabytes), recommended for large analytical and operatianl workloads. It is not recommended for
  transactional workloads because it does not support multi row transactions.



In-memory databases

- Recovering data from memory is faster than recovery data from disks.
- The recommended GCP service is Memory Store.

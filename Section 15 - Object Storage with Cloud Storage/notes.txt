What is Cloud Storage?

- Most popular, flexible and inexpensive storage service.
- It autoscales and can scale infinite.
- Used to store files (known as objects).
- Objects are stored in buckets.
- Buckets names are globally unique.
- The max size of a single object is 5 TB but you can have an unlimited number of objects.
- There are different kinds of storage classes that optimize your costs based on your access needs
  (how frequent are you going to access the files).
- We can configure a retention period to comply with regulatory and compliance requirements. You
  cannot delete the bucket unless al objects in it have an age greather than the retention period.



Storage classes

- Standard -> frequently used data, does not have a mininum storage duration.
- Nearline -> read or modify once a month on average, 30 days minimum storage duration.
- Coldline -> read or modify at most once a quarter, 90 days minimum storage duration.
- Archive -> less than once a year, 365 days minimum storage duration.



Object Versioning

- Prevents accidental deletion provides history.
- It is enabled at bucket level.
- In order to reduce costs, it is recommended to delete old versions of the objects.



Object Lifecycle

- We can manage and execute actions according to some conditions of our objects, the storage class,
  the amount of time since we uploaded it, etc.
- We can either delete the object or change the storage class (the changes are always to a storage
  class that defines a less used object).



Encryption

- Data is encrypted by default on the server side. There are different types of encryption:

  Google-managed: default, no configuration needed.
  Customer-managed: keys managed by customer in Cloud KMS.
  Customer-supplied: customer supplies the keys with every GCS operation.

- You can encrypt the data before upload it (client-side encryption).
- Google does not have any information about client-side encryption.



Metadata

- Each object in Cloud Storage can have metadata.
- There are some general metadata key and value pairs but we can define our custom metadata key and
  value pairs.



Transferring data to GCP

- GCP has different options according our needs, the size of the data and the network speed. For
  transfers of informations in which there is not a lot of data involved, we can use an online
  transfer. If we need a bigger transfer of data (greather than 20 TB or online transfer takes > 1
  week), we can use Cloud Storage Transfer Service.



Commands

- gsutil mb gs://my-bucket-from-shell-teban -> to create a bucket called
  "my-bucket-from-shell-teban".
- gsutil ls -a gs://my-bucket-from-shell-teban -> list files of the bucket.
- gsutil cp gs://source_bucket/object gs://destiny_bucket/name_copy -> to create a copy of a file.
- gsutil mv -> to move an object.
- gsutil rewrite -s STORAGE_CLASS gs://bucket_name/object -> to change the Storage Class of an
  object.

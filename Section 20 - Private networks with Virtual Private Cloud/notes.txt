What's VPC? 

- It is a way to create secure internal networks, to protect our resources, data and 
  communications.
- Different types of resources are created on the cloud (DB, services, etc) they should have
  different types of access needs too, for example, load balances are accessible from the
  Internet but databases or VM instances should not be accessible from the Internet.



CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) Blocks

- It is a way to express a range of addresses that resources in a network can have.
- If we have 69.208.0.0/28 Indicates that the first 28 bits (out of 32) are fixed and only the last
  4 bits can change. So, 2 to the power of 4 => 16 possible addresses.

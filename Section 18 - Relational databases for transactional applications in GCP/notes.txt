Relational Databases for transactional applications in GCP

Cloud SQL

- Fully managed relational database.
- Supports MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server.
- Regional DB providing high availability (99.95%).
- It provides automatic encryption, automatic backups, automatic failover, read replicas, and
  automated patching in different zones, automatic storage increase.
- If we enable the High Availability option, it will create a standby database in a different zone
  (but in the same region) and it will automatically failover to the standby database in case of a
  failure. The standby database is not a read replica.
- It cannot scale horizontally for writes, all of them should go to the primary instance.
- Use HDDs or SSDs, for best performance SSDs are required.
- Upto 416 of RAM and 30TB of storage.
- We should use Cloud Spanner (more expensive) if you have huge volumes of data, if you need
  infinite scalability, if you need a global database or if you need higher availability (99.999%).
- Exports are more flexible than backups, but they are not automatic. Exporting a huge amount of
  data can affect the performance of the database, in that case we can use a serverless export
  (--ofload flag). It is prefered to import/export in multiple batches instead of large batches.



Cloud Spanner

- Fully managed, relational, globally distributed database service with very high availability
  (99.999).
- Strong transactional consistency at global scale.
- Scales to PBs of data with automatic sharding.
- It scales horizontally for reads and writes.
- More expensive than Cloud SQL.

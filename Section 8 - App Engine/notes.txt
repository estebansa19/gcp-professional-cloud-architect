App Engine

It is the implest way to deploy and scale applications in GCP. It is a managed GCP service.

Features:

- Automatic load balancing and scaling.
- Managed platform updates and application monitoring.
- Traffic splitting (being able to have different versions of your application running at the same
  time for different sections of your customers).



Environments:

- Standard, applications run in language specific sandboxes. We have a complete isolation from the
  OS. It has 2 versions, V1 for old versions of a limited quantity of programming languages and V2
  for newer versions or programming languages and a extended support.

- Flexible, applications run in Docker containers



Application Component Hierarchy

Application -> Service -> Versions -> Instance

We can only have one application per project, is like the container of the services, we can have
one or more services (which are like code applications), we can have different versions per service
and those versions could have different instances attached, for instance, I can have the 30% of my
traffic routing to the V1 and the rest routing to the V2.


Environments comparison:

Pricing

- Standard charges you instance hours.
- Flexible vCPU, memory, disks.

Scaling

- Standard offers you: manual, basic and automatic.
- Flexible offers you: manual and automatic.

Scaling to zero

- Standard, yes.
- Flexible, no.

Instance startup time

- Standard, seconds.
- Flexible, minutes.

SSH for debuggin:

- Standard, no.
- Flexible, yes.



Scaling instances:

- Automatic, recommended for continuously running worloads. Automatically scale the instances based
  on: CPU utilization, concurrent request. You can configure a minimum and maximum of instances.
- Basic, instances are created as when the requests are received. Instances are shutdown if there
  are no load. High latency is possible if a new instance should be created.
- Manual, adjust the number of instances manually over time



Commands:

- gcloud config set project prefab-range-419901 -> set a project
- gcloud app deploy -> deploy an application
- gcloud app services/versions/instances list -> list information
- gcloud app deploy --version=v2 -> specify a deploy version
- gcloud app browse --version=20240410t012718 -> get information about a specific version
- gcloud app deploy --version=v3 --no-promote -> deploy without promoting the traffic to the new
  version
- gcloud app services set-traffic --splits=v3=0.5,v2=0.5 -> split traffic between versions
- gcloud app services set-traffic --splits=v3=0.5,v2=0.5 --split-by=random -> split traffic
  randomly
- gcloud app services/versions/instances list --service=my-first-service -> to specify a service

Why?

Becase we want low latency (even if our users are from different parts of the world, deploying our
application in different regions will give us low latency) and high availability (having our
application deployed in different regions and data centers ensures that if there is a crash in a
data center, our app will still be available from the others).

Zones

Each of the regions has at least, 3 zones, so we can have low latency in a specific region and high
availability if we have our application deployed in differente zones of that region.

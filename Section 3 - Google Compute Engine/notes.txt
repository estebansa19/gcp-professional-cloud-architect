Compute Engine

Features

Is a service that provides us Virtual Machines (VM) or virtual servers on GCP.
They have some features:

- Create and manage the lifecycle of Virtual Machines (start, restart, close).
- Load balancing and auto scaling for multiple VM instances.
- Manage network configuration and connectivity for our VM instances.



IPs

- External IP addresses are addressable on the Internet.
- Internal IP addresses are internal to the corporate network (GCP).
- When we restart a VM, the external IP address is lost. (We can fix that using a static external
  IP address).



Instance templates

- Is a way to avoid having to configure our instances (type of machine, startup script, etc) every
  time you launch an instance.
- We can use it to launch an individual Virtual Machine or a group of Virtual Machines.
- Cannot be updated.



Custom images

- Installing OS updates, patches, and software might takes several time (instance templates), it
  could be a problem.
- We can create a custom image with the OS updates, patches and software pre-installed.
- It's preferible to use a custom image over a startup script (due to the boot time).

Important things architecting solutions on GCP:
- Build resiliency
- Increase availability
- Increase scability
- Improve performance
- Improve security
- Lower costs



What is availability?

Are the applications available when the users need them? (percentage of time an application is
working)

i.e: 99.99% of availability (which means 22 minutes of downtime per month).



What is scalability?

Can we handle a growth in users, traffic, data, etc, without losing performance? Is the ability to
adapt to changes in demand, users, data.

Types of scalability:

- Vertical: deploying the application to a bigger instance, a faster CPU, more RAM, I/O, networking
  capabilities.
- Horizontal: deploying multiple instances of our application/database. Typically, is prefered over
  vertical scaling. Horizontal scaling has no limits, it's cheaper and increase the availability of
  the application.
- If we need to do upgrade in our software or hardware, how do we keep our VM instances running? We
  can use Live Migration, it will move the VM instances to another host while the operation is executed.



Compute Engine GPUs

- Used for math intensive and graphics intensive workloads, AI, ML, etc.



Security

- Firewall rules, to restrict the traffic that is coming in (ingress) and going out (egress).
- Use internal IP addresses if possible.
- Create a hardened custom image to launch our VMs.



Performace

- Choose the right machine family type for our workload.
- Create a hardened custom image so the start time of our virtual machines is faster.



Resiliency

- Ability of a system to provide acceptable behavior even when some parts of the system fail.
- Build resilient architectures (VMs in Multiple Instance Groups behind Load Balancing).
- Use health checks.
- Use Live Migration and Automatic Restart.



Discounts

They are applicable for instances created by the Kubernetes Engine and Compute Engine.

- Sustained use discounts: discounts based on the use you give to the VM, if you use it more,
  .you will get more discount
- Commited use discounts: discounts for a long term commitment of use, i.e: 1 year, 3 years. This
  offers you more discount than the sustained use discounts.



Spot VM

- Short-lived cheaper (60 - 91% discount) compute instances.
- Use preemptive VMs if your application is fault tolerant, if you are very cost sensitive.
- They are not always availabile.
- Free tier credits not applicable.



Billing in Compute Engine

- You are billed for seconds (after one minute).
- You are not billed for a VM when the instance is stopped.
- Create budget alerts.



Cost efficiency

- Use the optimal amount of VMs (auto scaling).
- Sustained use discounts (discounts for using a instance).
- Commited use discounts (discounts for a long term commitment).
- Spot VMs (fault tolerant workloads).

What is IAM (Identity and access management)?

- It is a tool to authenticate and authorizate identities on GCP.
- Identities can be: a user, a group of users, an internal application, an external application.
- IAM provides us very granular control of the actions that an identitie can do. (the action, the
  cloud resource, the IP address, the time window).



IAM step by step example

1. Choose a role (set of permissions) with right permission (ex: Storage Object Admin).
2. Create a policy binding member (your friend) with role (permissions).



Roles

- Roles are permissions (perform some set of actions on some set of resources).
- Basic roles (primitive roles) not recommended to use in production

  Viewer -> Read only actions.
  Editor -> Viewer + edit actions.
  Owner -> Editor + manage roles and permissions + billing.

- Predefined roles, fine grained roles and managed by Google. Examples: Storage Admin, Storage
  Object Admin, Storage Object Viewer, Storage Object Creator.
- Custom roles, when predefined roles are not sufficient, we can create our custom roles.



Policies

- Roles (set of permissions) are assigned to members (who?) through policies.



Service Accounts

- Are internal managed accounts that GCP provides us to authenticate and authorize resources.
- They are identified by an email address.
- They don't have a password.
- Service Accounts types

  Default -> automatically created when some services are used (not recommended, they have the
    editor role by default).
  User managed -> user created (recommended, because provides grained access control).
- If we are trying to connect or to use a GCP service from the outside, we can create a service
  account with the right role and permissions, create a key for that service account and then we
  could authenticate from the outside as that service account.
- We can give short term permissions instead of using the service account keys, it is safer.

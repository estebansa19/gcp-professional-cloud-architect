What is encryption?

- What would happen if an external entity gets access to our data?
- We can encrypt the data at rest (databases data, disk data), transitional data (data that is
  traveling across the network), and data in use (active data processed in a non-persistent state,
  like RAM).
- We have 2 ways to encrypt the data:

  Symmetric key encryption: we use the same key to encrypt and decrypt the data.
  Asymmetric key encryption: we use different keys to encrypt and decrypt. Typically, we share our
    public key to encrypt the data and we decrypt the data with our private key. It is possible to
    discover the private key with our public key but it will take years.



KMS (Key Management Service)

- Allow us to create and manage cryptographic keys (symmetric and asymmetric).
- We can have different type of keys.

  Google-managed key: no configuration required.
  Customer-managed key: when we want to create and configure a key.
  Customer-supplied key: you provide your own key.

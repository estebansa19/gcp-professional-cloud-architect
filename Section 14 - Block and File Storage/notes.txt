Block Storage

- One Block Storage device can be connected to one virtual server.
- You can connect multiple Block Storage devices to one virtual server.
- Use case: hard disks.
- Options in GCP: persistent disks, local SSDs.

File Storage:

- Shared storage.
- When you have to share files or data between several servers in a organized way.
- Options in GCP: Filestore.



Local SSDs

- Physically attached to the host of VM instance, very high IOPS and very low latency.
- Ephemeral storage - Temporary data (data persists only until instance is running).
- Data automatically configured and managed by Google Cloud.
- Advantages:

  Very fast IO (10-100x compared to persistent disks).
  Ideal for cases that need high IOPs while storing temporary information.

- Disadvantages:

  Low durability, the data is ephemeral.
  You cannot detach and attach it to another VM instance.



Persistent Disks

- Network block storage attached to a VM instance.
- Very flexible, you can increase the size when you need it.
- Performance scales with size.
- Independent lifecycle from the VM instance (you can attach and detach from one instance to
  another).
- Use case: run your custom DB.



Snapshots

- They are nothing more thank backups of our disks, they are incremental and we can schedule them.



Machine Images

- Contains everything you need to create a VM. On the other side, an Image contains everythin
  required to setup a OS. It can copy the permissions, disks, everything.

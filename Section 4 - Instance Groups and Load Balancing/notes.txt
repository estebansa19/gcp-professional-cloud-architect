Instance Groups

- Is a group of VM instances managed as a single entity.
- There are two types:

  Managed Instance Groups, they use identical VMs created with a template, it provides us, auto
  scalling according to the usage of our instances; auto healing with health checks that if a
  problem with a VM is detected, that VM will be replaced; managed releases, which is
  important to have 0 downtime time with our deploy processes; load balancers, to distribute the
  load; also, we can create instances in multiples zones for higher availability.

  Unmanaged Instance Groups, they use differente configurations in the same group, it does not
  provide the same features as Managed Instances do (auto scalling, auto healing, managed
  releases).



Updating a Managed Instance Group

- It can be done in 2 ways:

  Rolling updates, gradual update of instances in an instance group to a new instance template. It
  is gradual, for instance, in groups of 2 instance each time.

  Canary testing, you first update a minor amount of instance for testing, then you release the
  update to the rest of the instances at once.




Cloud Load Balancing

- Distributes the user traffic across instances of an application.
- Features: auto scaling, global load balancing with single anycast IP.
- It gives us high availability in our applications.
- SSL/TSL Termination/Offloading, when configuring a load balancer on GCP, the communication
  between the Internet and our load balancer should be over HTTPS so we are sure the communication
  is safe. However, when we are talking about the communication between our load balancer and our
  VMs, the communciation could be over HTTP, our VM instances don't need to worry about SSL/TSL
  certifications. This will reduce the load in our instances.

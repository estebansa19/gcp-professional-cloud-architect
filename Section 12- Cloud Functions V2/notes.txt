What's new?

- Longer request timeout (up to 60 minutes).
- More powerful instances.
- Concurrency (The same instance can hadle up to 1000 concurrent requests per function intance.
  Before, one instance could handle 1 request at a time. You can configure this in Cloud Run).
- It uses Cloud Run in the background (When you create a Cloud Function, it starts to build a Cloud
  Run image in the background).



Best practices

- To avoid cold starts (when there is no a instances running and an instance has to be initialized
  to handle a request), set a minimum number of instances (increases cost).
- Configure max number of instances (to protect yourself from abnormally high requests levels).
- Use Cloud Run for safer releases, you can configure which version should receive traffic and how
  much. You can also rollback to a previous version if needed.
